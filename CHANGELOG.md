# Sourcey Changelog

## v0.0.1 - "Initial Commit"
This is the start of the project! We basically have an electron app, a (very) basic building system that will let you start in development mode with some fun tools (auto refresh, devtools panel) and a build command that currently spits out a basic OS X only build.

The app itself currently supports React UI Components, with auto transpiling for es6 + jsx. It also brings in Bootstrap UI Framework. It currently opens with a simple React-y Hello World.

Lets see what happens now!
