# Sourcey Roadmap

v0.0.3
-------
'Commit List'
- for an open repo it should list all the commits in the repo history
- this list should include commit messages, details about the commit and code diffs
- (potentially) include the graphical commit tree

v0.0.2
-------
'Open Repo'
- ability to open a repo in a window and display some basic information about it
- open more than one repo in separate windows and have this work fully sandboxed
- should be able to open a directory that isn't a repo and initialize a repo in there

v0.0.1
-------
'Hello World' 
- a decent building and tooling system
- UI components that include styling
- some example of stateful data flow
